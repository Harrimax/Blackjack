Winning.
The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without going over 21. If the dealer's hand goes over 21, all remaining players win. If the game ends in a tie, it's called a "push" and the bet is returned. 
Card values.
Face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) and 10s count as 10, Aces can be counted as 1 or 11, and all other cards are worth their face value. 
Busting.
If a player's hand goes over 21, it's called a "bust" and they lose.
